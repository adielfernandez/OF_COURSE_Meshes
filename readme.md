# OF COURSE - ofMesh Class

## Description

This workshop is designed to take you through some of the core features of Openframeworks' powerful ofMesh class. Taking advantage of OF's OpenGL core, meshes are an easy way to build complex geometries that are naturally hardware accelerated by the GPU. Using vertices, indices, colors and texture coordinates, it's relatively easy to create visuals in an impressively wide array of styles and aesthetics.

*"01_Mesh_Modes"
Build a simple tool to draw points and allow the mesh to connect them to get a sense for how the different mesh assemply modes work

*"02_Mesh_From_Primitive"
Use a mesh primitive as a stepping stone to build your mesh then go back in and manipulate it in different ways. Also, use colors and texture coordinates to give your mesh some life

*"03_Mesh_Assembly"
Build a mesh from scratch by adding points in the correct order to assemble a plane. 

*"04_Mesh_Lighting"
Add texture, materiality and lighting (as well as some algorithmic manpulation) to the mesh to make your own undulating watery planet

*"05_Mesh_Indices"
Add randomized points to the screen and use indices to dynamically connect them.


## What is ofCourse?

This class was created as part of [ofCourse](http://www.ofcourse.io/), a creative coding program aimed at people with little to no coding skills. It provides a hands-on experience, tools, ideas, and full support for students to make their own projects.
