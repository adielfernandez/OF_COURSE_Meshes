# OF COURSE - ofMesh Class

## Description

This workshop is designed to take you through some of the core features of Openframeworks' powerful ofMesh class. Taking advantage of OF's OpenGL core, meshes are an easy way to build complex geometries that are naturally hardware accelerated by the GPU. Using vertices, indices, colors and texture coordinates, it's relatively easy to create visuals in an impressively wide array of styles and aesthetics.

## What is ofCourse?

This class was created as part of [ofCourse](http://www.ofcourse.io/), a creative coding program aimed at people with little to no coding skills. It provides a hands-on experience, tools, ideas, and full support for students to make their own projects.
